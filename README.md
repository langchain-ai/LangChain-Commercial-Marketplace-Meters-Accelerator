## Introduction

The Azure Managed Application (AMA) Meter Scheduler is an opensource production-ready solution that enables partners to implement and manage advanced Meter models for Azure Marketplace AMA offers.

### Advantages

üöÄ **Quick & easy deployment:** Go live in under 15 minutes.‚Äã

üí≤ **Flexible Meter:** Surpass the constraints of current Meter features. Enable yearly Meter, milestone payments, and handling complex pricing models.‚Äã

üõ†Ô∏è **Design in advance:** Allow partners to design and create price models per plan prior having an active subscription.‚Äã

üíº **Subscription Management** : Partner will manage and track subscriptions status.

‚≠ê **No more exception requests:** Eliminate the need for requesting an exception for partners to support price model needs.

### Capabilities

The AMA Meter Scheduler may be installed as-is or may be customized to support your requirements. The project provides the following capabilities.

1. A webhook that listens for subscription notification events
2. A private portal for the publisher to monitor customer subscriptions and scheduler payment
3. A Meter engine to execute the scheduler payments

The accelerator is implemented in .NET and uses the commercial marketplace Meter system, including the [Partner Center Ingestion API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/product-ingestion-api) and [Marketplace Metering Service API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/marketplace-metering-service-apis). The AMA Meter Scheduler models how a typical SaaS platform interacts with the marketplace APIs to provision subscriptions for customers, enable logging, and manage commercial marketplace subscriptions.

This code is a reference implementation of optional components of a commercial marketplace AMA offer and complements the existing commercial marketplace documentation.

## Stay current with the latest updates!

The AMA Meter Scheduler project team releases regularly releases new versions. Please see the [release notes page](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-app-Meter-scheduler/releases) for updates. We recommend keeping up to date with latest releases to stay current on security patches, bug fixes, and new features.

## Intended Use

This project accelerates the AMA offer onboarding experience for those building using metered Meter to submit custom price model. Whether installed and used as-is or customized for your particular requirements, this reference implementation provides all main components required by a commercial marketplace AMA offer.

## Installation

**[Installation instructions are here](./docs/Installation-Instructions.md)**, as well as documents detailing architecture and scaled installation considerations are also available. Following these instructions will typically have the AMA Meter Scheduler installed in 20 minutes or less.
